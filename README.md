## Laravel Filament Project

This is a Laravel Filament project that I created to learn how to use the Filament package. Filament is a free open-source Laravel package that allows you to create an admin panel for your Laravel application. It is a great package that allows you to create a beautiful admin panel for your Laravel application with minimal effort. In this project, I created a simple blog application with Filament.

3. Create a new database and add the database credentials to the .env file
4. Migrate the database

5. Run the server

6. Visit the application in your browser
